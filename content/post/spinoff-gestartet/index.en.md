**"Kleiderbügel" (Clothes Hangers) started as a spin-off of [Blaufußtölpel](https://blaufusstölpel.de):** At some point, even the hottest fashion trends are ready for the closet, having exceeded their half-life or simply fallen out of favor. That's when clothes hangers come into their own. Some of these practical helpers from days gone by are documented here. Many of the examples shown here also offer insight into local economic history and the past diversity of retail as advertising media.

Even questionable examples are sure to find their way into this closet—no one will see them anyway...
